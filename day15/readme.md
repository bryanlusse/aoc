# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 15: Lens Library

ðŸŒŸ **Happy Advent of Code!** ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## Part 1

In today's task we are asked to compute a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) for different strings. This assignment is pretty straightforward, but the amount of text can cause some trouble. Just focus on the most important part, the hash algorithm.

## Part 2

In the second part, we are required to create a [hashmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table). We map hash values to boxes where we keep track of different lenses. The logic here is also quite straightforward. Make sure to cover all scenario's and do not use `str.startswith()` in order to find labels to replace (some labels seem to be very similar to each other). Instead use the whole label string.

Happy coding!
