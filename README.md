# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 Repository 🌟

Welcome to my Python repository for Advent of Code 2023! 🚀🎉

## 📅 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that runs throughout December, challenging participants with a daily puzzle to solve. Each day unveils two parts of a problem, and success rewards you with stars! 🌟🌟

## 🎁 Repository Structure

Every day contains a readme with some comments about the challenge and the python files for the solution.
