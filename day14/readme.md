# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish

ðŸŒŸ **Happy Advent of Code!** ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## Part 1

Our task is to code what happens when we tilt a `parabolic reflector dish` that consists of rounded rocks (`O`), cube-shaped rocks (`#`) and empty spaces (`.`). The rounded rocks will roll when the platform is tilted, while the cube-shaped rocks will stay in place. It is our job to find the new locations of the rounded rocks after we tilt the dish to the north.

Make sure to take into account:

- The edges of the map
- What happens when multiple rocks will roll into the same place

## Part 2

TBD

Happy coding!
