# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 10: Pipe Maze

ðŸŒŸ **Happy Advent of Code!** ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## Part 1

We are given some input file with characters that make up a pipe maze. It is our job to find the distance between a certain point on this maze and the furthest away point. I do this by traversing the full pipe maze and dividing the length by two. In the end I brute forced it as I can not spend too much time, but the solution can definitely be improved.

Happy coding!
